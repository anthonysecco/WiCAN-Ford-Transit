# Parameter IDs

OBD-II PIDs (Parameter IDs) are standardized codes used to request data from a vehicle’s electronic control units (ECUs) via the On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) port. They’re used by diagnostic tools, scan gauges, and systems like Home Assistant (via CAN integration) to read real-time sensor data.

There's two "Modes" of interest

### Modes

**Mode 1** shows "standard" PIDs as specified by SAE.  This includes common things like speed, RPM etc.

**Mode 22** shows manufacture specific data.  This is where we can get some detailed information about the vehicle.  Manufactures usually standardize around set of code across vehicles.  This means we can take things found on the F-150 or Explorer and apply it to the Transit given simialries in powertrain and modules.

### CAN Bus

The Ford Transit (especially 2020 and newer models) typically includes three main CAN buses, each serving different types of modules based on speed and priority. These buses are part of the vehicle’s network architecture that allows electronic modules to communicate.

## Modules

### All-Wheel Drive Module (AWDM)

On the 2021 Transit AWD has a RWD-biased system that can divert up to 50% of the torque to the front wheels by activating a electronic-hydraulic clutch pack.  This is called a Front Axle Disconnect (FAD) system (sometimes also called the Front‐Axle Drive clutch). 

In its mechanically default position, the front drive shaft is disconnected.  When the AWDM activates the electronic-hydraulic clutch pack, it connects the front drive shaft.  Up to 50% of engine torque can be diverted to the front wheels if the clutch is fully engaged.

| **Wheels** | **Total Torque** |
| Front Wheels | 0-50% |
| Rear Wheels | 0-100% |

While in technical terrian, it may be useful to display the torque split between front/rear wheels.

I've consolidated the available sensors to the following as most relevant:

#### Front-Axle Disconnect Actuator Status  
Shows the real-time state of the Front-Axle Disconnect actuator.  
- **“FAD in 4WD – CONNECTED”** means the front driveshaft is actively engaged, supplying torque to the front & rear wheels.  
- **“FAD in 2WD – DISCONNECTED”** would indicate the front axle is released and supplying torque to only rear-wheel drive only.

#### Front-Axle Disconnect Strategy Command  
The high-level strategy request from the PCM governing AWD mode.  
- **Connect Request** signals “go AWD”—the system wants front-axle engagement.  
- **Disconnect Request** signals “back to RWD”—the system wants the front axle released.  
- **Modulate** (if supported) requests smooth, partial engagement to meter torque split.

> All states above have yet to be confirmed.

#### Front Axle Disconnect Input Duty Cycle  
The PWM duty-cycle (0–100 %) applied to the disconnect control valve.  
- **0 %** means no disengage signal (clutch remains engaged).
- Higher values ramp open the clutch pack proportionally, allowing controlled slip or full disconnect.
- **100 %** means full disengage signal (clutch disengaged) 

> Engage/disengage spectrum yet to be confirmed

#### Torque Converter Clutch Duty-Cycle  
The PWM duty-cycle (0–100 %) applied to the torque-converter clutch solenoid to control lock-up pressure.  
- **Low duty-cycle** = minimal lock-up (more fluid coupling >> more slip, more heat, ).  
- **High duty-cycle** = stronger lock-up (more mechanical coupling >> more efficiency, less heat).

## Body Control Module (BCM)

The Body Control Module (BCM) is the central controller for all non-powertrain electrical functions—monitoring and managing door-ajar, hood and luggage-lid switches; key-in/ignition and PATS security; lighting (headlamps, turn signals, courtesy lights); horn and crash detection; tire-pressure monitoring; and battery state (voltage, current, temperature, age and cumulative charge/discharge).
