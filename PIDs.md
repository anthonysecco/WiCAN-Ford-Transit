# PID List
OBD-II PIDs (On-Board Diagnostics Parameter Identifers) are standardized codes used to request data from a vehicle’s electronic control units (ECUs) via the OBD port. They’re used by diagnostic tools and scan gauges.  In this case, I would like to implement it with Home Assistant.

The expressions below maintain the native unit of measurement from the PID, typically metric.  They may be converted to your unit of preference in your application.  In the case of Home Assistant, I convert these units to US Imperial in the MQTT YAML configuration.

Manufactures usually standardize around set of code across vehicles.  This means we can take things found on the F-150 or Explorer and apply it to the Transit given simialries in powertrain and modules.

## CAN Basics

When pulling PIDs, there's two "Modes" of interest:

- **Mode 1** shows "standard" PIDs as specified by SAE.  This includes common things like speed, RPM etc.

- **Mode 22** shows manufacture specific data.  This is where we can get some detailed information about the vehicle.  

The Ford Transit (especially 2020 and newer models) typically includes three main CAN buses, each serving different types of modules based on speed and priority. These buses are part of the vehicle’s network architecture that allows electronic modules to communicate.

## Modules
The list of modules and PIDs is not exhaustive.  

| Bus       | Abbreviation | CAN ID (Hex) | Module Name                  |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| HS-CAN1   | PCM          | 0x7E0          | Powertrain Control Module    |
| HS-CAN1   | BCM          | 0x726          | Body Control Module          |
| HS-CAN1   | AWDM         | 0x703          | All-Wheel Drive Module       |

PIDs are broken out below by module.

Each module will be broken out by the following:
- PID = Hex Value of Parameter ID
- Name = Short name
- Description = Human understand description
- Units = metric unit for PID
- Expression = Translate value to decimal form, typically  metric unit.
- Status = Status as it relates to WiCAN in this project.

### SAE Standard (OBD)
Full definition of J1979 standard [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs).  The PCM technically offers up standardized OBD PIDs.

As of Wican v4.12, the following OBD PIDs work and provide data:

#### Drive Mode
Selectable modes on the dashboard.  Adjusts programing of PCM, AWDM, and ABS for different driving modes.  This will report current mode.

- 05 → Slippery
- 08 → Mud & Ruts
- 03 → Tow / Haul

#### Gear Commanded
- 70 → Park
- 60 → Reverse
- 50 → Neutral
- 1 to 10  → Drive(actual forward gear)

#### A/C Compressor Switch

- 01 → ON
- 00 → OFF

#### Brake On/Off

- 06 → ON Pedal Pressed
- 00 → OFF

#### Wastegate Solenoid
Indicates duty cycle % sent to wastegate to **OPEN** and release excess boost pressure.

#### Oil Life %
0-100%, same as shown on the instrument panel.

#### Alternator Duty Cycle
Represents the PCM’s PWM-duty command to the alternator’s regulator, not direct alternator load. The PCM monitors system voltage and adjusts duty cycle: increasing it under electrical demand (lights, HVAC, winch) to raise output, or decreasing it when voltage is high to prevent overcharging.

Low duty (10–30%) at cruise shows minimal charging; high duty (50–100%) under heavy load or low RPM indicates maximum alternator output. Since GENCMD controls rather than senses current or torque, pair it with Mode 22 Battery Current PID (0x2142) and voltage PIDs to see actual amps and charging load.

#### Learned Octane Ratio 
The Learned Octane Ratio (LOR) is a closed-loop multiplier the PCM uses to adjust load and spark timing based on knock feedback. As the engine runs, it advances timing for efficiency, backing off if knock occurs. This allows the EcoBoost to optimize performance for the fuel’s octane without manual tuning.

LOR is a relative factor, not a direct octane reading. Ford calibrates 0.0 to the recommended 87 AKI. On 87-octane, LOR stays near 0.0; below 0.0 indicates higher octane (more advance), while above 0.0 indicates lower octane (less advance).

- LOR ≈ 0.0 → recommended 87 AKI
- LOR < 0.0 → higher octane → more spark advance
- LOR > 0.0 → lower octane → spark retard

> ℹ️ Exact AKI equivalents for LOR values are not available.  If you know how this works, open an issue.

#### Fuel pump duty cycle 
The PCM’s PWM command to the low-pressure (lift) fuel pump in the tank. Rather than simply switching the pump fully on or off, the PCM modulates the pump’s duty between 0–100 % to precisely control the flow and maintain the target feed pressure for the high-pressure direct-injection system. This can be useful for how how hard the fuel pump is working drawing fuel from the tank.

#### Fuel Rate  
Mass of fuel consumed in grams per second.  Useful when calculating MPG when combined with speed.

#### Fuel System Status
**Open Loop** - Fuel Ratio determined based on static table.  Used on cold start and wide-open throttle situations
**Closed Loop** - Fuel ratio is determined using measurements from narrowband oxygen sensors to maintain stochmetic fuel ratio of 14.67:1

#### Fuel Pressure Desired
PCM Desired fuel pressure based on calculated engine load.

#### Fuel Pressure Sensor
Actual fuel pressure measured.  Difference between pressure sensor and desired pressure determines pump duty cycle.

## Body Control Module (BCM)
The Body Control Module (BCM) is the central controller for all non-powertrain electrical functions—monitoring and managing door-ajar, hood and luggage-lid switches; key-in/ignition and PATS security; lighting (headlamps, turn signals, courtesy lights); horn and crash detection; tire-pressure monitoring; and battery state (voltage, current, temperature, age and cumulative charge/discharge).
